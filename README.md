Sentiment Analysis API with Flask and Swagger

Overview
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis API project! This project demonstrates the integration of Flask and Swagger for building a robust API that leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and NN (Neural Network) models to perform text sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the emotional tone and sentiment expressed in a piece of text, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.

Features
Flask and Swagger Integration: The API is built using Flask, a popular web framework for Python, and is documented using Swagger. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface for testing and interacting with the API endpoints.

Sentiment Analysis: The core functionality of the API is sentiment analysis, which classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral. The LSTM and NN models are employed to provide accurate sentiment predictions.

Easy-to-Use API: The API is designed to be straightforward to use. Users can submit text for sentiment analysis via API endpoints, making it suitable for integration with various applications.
